# Vipassana theme for IntelliJ

My first tryout of doing an IntelliJ theme, being inspired
by the clean design of [Qiita](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Increments.qiita&ssr=false#overview) theme that exists for VSCode.

### TODOs

- left background of a selected element<br/>(currently has a slightly gradient blue background)
- modal window title background (ex: New File window)
- dropdown background
- icon buttons hover background & foreground
